        <p>Make sure you have downloaded the appropriate form from the server before filling out the form for
            the patient. If not, go to the forms page. Navigate to the ONLINE tab which will list all the forms
            available on the server. Select the form you want and then download it.</p>

        <p>Once you successfully download the form, return to the home page. Then follow the following steps:</p>
            <ol start="1">
                <li>Click the name of the patient you want in the patient list.</li>
                <li>Select the appropriate form. That is, the one you downloaded in the FORM FILLING tab
                within the Data Collection menu on the patient summary page.</li>
